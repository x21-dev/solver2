///
/// CMA-MAE (Fontaine and Nikolaidis, "Covariance Matrix Adaptation
/// MAP-Annealing", 2023): CMA-ES emitters whose candidates are ranked by
/// how far their value is above their cell's threshold. A cell's threshold
/// starts at the archive's minimum score and, each time a candidate beats
/// it, moves towards that candidate's value by the archive learning rate
/// alpha. At alpha 0 the emitters optimise the value alone; at alpha 1 the
/// threshold is the cell's best value, which is CMA-ME: only a better
/// candidate or a new cell counts. In between, a cell is worth exploring
/// until its threshold has caught up with what it holds. The archive itself
/// keeps the best candidate ever found in each cell (the paper's result
/// archive).
///
/// solver adds an aim CMA-MAE reaches only indirectly (through its
/// thresholds and, once they have caught up, density descent): cells no
/// candidate has found yet. Explorers (the last emitters) head for empty
/// cells, down the grid's distance, and take a new target when they reach
/// theirs or get stuck; the improvers refine what the archive holds.
///
/// Infeasible candidates never enter the archive; emitters rank them below
/// every feasible candidate, by how far over the limits they are. An
/// improver restarts from a random elite when a few generations add
/// nothing, or are nearly all infeasible.
///
/// With a model (`ArchiveSurrogate`), explorers and optionally improvers
/// sample a larger population and render the share the model ranks best
/// (the rest at random); an explorer may also start where the model
/// predicts nearest its target.
///
/// Deterministic: emitter k draws from its own seed, every emitter's
/// population is evaluated in one batch, and the candidates enter the
/// archive in a fixed order (emitter by emitter, in population order), so
/// a seed gives the same archive on any thread count.
///
/// A run is plain data between iterations (`ArchiveRun`): saved and
/// restored field by field, it goes on as the run that never stopped
